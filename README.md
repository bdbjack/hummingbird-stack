# Hummingbird Stack Framework

*A lightweight, fast and easy-to-use framework*

## Using Hummingbird

Hummingbird stack is best used as a git submodule. To add it to another Git repository simply run the following from within the project:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/bdbjack/hummingbird-stack.git
```

Then, you should include the /hummingbird-stack/hbs/hbs.php file in your project as close to the top as possible:

```php
<?php
	require_once realpath( dirname( __FILE__ ) ) . '/hummingbird-stack/hbs/hbs.php';
```

Initialize the application as follows

```php
<?php
	try {
		$hba = new \Hummingbird\HummingbirdApp();
	}
	catch ( Exception $e ) {
		// Handle your errors here
	}
```

And once you have setup your app using the API's below, run the application as follows:

```php
<?php
	try {
		$hba->run();
	}
	catch ( Exception $e ) {
		// Handle your errors here
	}
```
